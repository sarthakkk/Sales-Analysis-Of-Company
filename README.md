In this project i have walk through all the steps that are used in real life sales anlaysis of any company technolgies used in this project are mysql work bench and powerbi .Firstly I got the data of a company name Atliq which sells hardware product. the data which i got was in the form of sql form so I warehouse the data in mysql work bench and after that connected power bi to mysql workbench manually and then after uploading the data I explored the different table that were present in the record and form the relationship between them though the power bi has a powerful engine where it can automatically form relation between the table but still we can do it manually as well and performed some EDA operations on the data such as data cleaning removing data redundancy ,droping the unwanted features , removing null values and also outlier actually outliers decreases the efficiency of data set and also create noise in the dataset so it needs to be removed. and then finally performed some data visualisation and made various reports and combined all that into dashbords
